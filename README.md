# discord-massdm-selfbot
A tool for messaging everyone in your dm's with a message. Very low chances of being detected and easy to setup/use!

Warning :
Although it's very unlikely. If you get banned on Discord for using this, it isn't my fault.
Anything you do with this tool, you do of your own will.

Q : How do I setup the tool?

A : First of all install python, I recommend Python 3.8.10, once installed run setup.bat and wait until it's finished. Then put your token in message.py and save, then open it and     you're ready to go.

Q : How do I get my token?

A : Getting your token is an easy process. You can find a video explaining how to get it here. (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YEgFvgg7ZPI&t=45s)

Q : Can I modify the files and change it?

A : I mean you could, but i'd appriciate if you just gave me credit and used the tool as is.

Q : "When I open setup.bat It get's stuck installing dotenv, how do I fix this?"

A : That's not an issue with the file. If it get's stuck download the .whl file and open that, it should fix it. (https://pypi.org/project/python-dotenv/#files)

Q : Is this a token logger?

A : No. The token is only kept in the message.py file, and is stored locally.
